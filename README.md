# NPM Package Template

To get started, use this repo as a template and do the following:

- Update the details in package.json
- Update the assignees in .github/dependabot.yml
- Add your NPM_TOKEN to the repository secrets (needed to publish to NPM)
- Add your GIT_PUSH_TOKEN to the repository secrets (needed to auto-increment the version number)
- Import the "Protect Main.json" file to the branch protection settings

Branch protection is set up for the main branch, requiring you to PR into main, have at least one review, and pass CI checks. Creating a PR will also automatically increment the patch number.

Comes with ESLint, Prettier, and Jest set up. To run tests, use `npm test`. To run linting, use `npm run lint`. To run prettier, use `npm run format`.

Commits to main are automatically published to NPM (provided your CI checks pass and you've changed the package name).
